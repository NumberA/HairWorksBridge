* Some refactoring of C++ and shader codes.

Artist Workflow
=============
HairWorks assets are imported directly into the content browser. All the attributes of a HairWorks asset are now directly editable on the asset’s Details panel. The details panel is set up to be consistent with the HairWorks Viewer’s UI as close as possible.

To use a HairWorks asset on a character, it must be added as a BluePrint component.

Known Issues
=============
* Indirect Lighting may not light Hair correctly on occluded side of character.
* HairWorks visualizers do work in play mode.
* HairWorks shadow maps are generally crisper when compared to other objects in scene.
* Duplicated property categories in HairWorks assets and components. 
* Needs to read data back from GPU buffer to CPU for dynamic pin, so there would be potential performance issue.
