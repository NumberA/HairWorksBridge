[EXCERPT:Intro]
**SkeletalControls** (also called SkelControls) allow direct control of bones within a Skeleton. These can be 
used within Animation Blueprints to control an individual bone, create IK chains, and more. This direct control of the 
underlying Skeleton provides the ability to create procedural, dynamically-driven animation. The Transform of 
one bone can be used to drive another or traces can be used to conform the feet of a character to the ground while 
playing a generic walk animation. Any sort of modification can be used to tweak or completely override the bone 
Transforms applied by AnimationSequences.

## Common Pins and Properties

Some pins and properties are common to all SkeletalControls. These are described below.

| Pin | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Input Pins**[/REGION] ||
| **Component Pose** | The input pose to be transformed. |
| **Alpha** | A float value in the range [0.0, 1.0] to use as the alpha value to determine the weighting of the Transform applied by the SkeletalControl. A value of 0.0 gives full weighting to the input pose, while a value of 1.0 gives full weighting to the control's computed Transform. |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Output Pins**[/REGION] ||
| Pose (Blank) | The final pose after the Transform has been applied. |

## Apply a Percentage of Rotation

The **Apply a Percentage of Rotation** control drives the Rotation of a target bone at some specified percentage 
of the Rotation of another bone within the Skeleton.

## Copy Bone

The **Copy Bone** control copies the Transform data or any component of it - i.e. Translation, Rotation, or 
Scale - from one bone to another.

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Copy**[/REGION] ||
| **Target Bone** | Name of the target bone to copy Transform to. |
| **Source Bone** | Name of the source bone to get Transform from. |

## Transform (Modify) Bone

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Skeletal Control**[/REGION] ||
| **Bone To Modify** | Name of the target bone to modify the Transform of. |

| Pin | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Input Pins**[/REGION] ||
| **Translation** | A Vector specifying the Translation to apply to the target bone. |
| **Rotation** | A Rotator specifying the Rotation to apply to the target bone. |
| **Scale** | A Vector specifying the Scale to apply to the target bone. |


## Bone Driven Controller

The **Bone Driven Controller** allows a "Driver" bone to dynamically affect the motion of one or more "Driven" bones. This is useful for characters that have accessories attached as you can use this to avoid geometry from intersecting during an animation, even when a lot of blending is being used. 

You can either set the "Driver" value directly with a **Multiplier**, remap it to a whole new range, or use a **Curve** asset to drive the motion. Using a Curve is usually the best approach as it lest you define the response naturally and interactively tweak points/tangents while seeing the changes reflected in real-time.  

In the example below, the attached accessory (green) has no authored animations, and is being driven in two axes as a function of the character's thigh bone. This is all calculated at runtime, so a blend of animations ends up working quite well here, even without hand-authored tweaking.

## Spring Controller

The **Spring Controller** applies a spring solver that can be used to limit how far a bone can stretch from 
its reference pose position and apply a force in the opposite direction.

![Apply Percentage of Rotation](node_springcontroller.png)

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Spring**[/REGION] ||
| **Spring Bone** | Name of the bone to apply the spring solver to. |
| **Limit Displacement** | If enabled, the spring solver is applied. |
| **Max Displacement** | The maximum distance the bone can stretch. |
| **Spring Stiffness** | A multiplier for the amount of force applied by the spring. Larger values require more bone velocity to displace the bone and result in a larger applied force. |
| **Spring Damping** | The amount of the bone's velocity removed by the spring. |
| **Error Reset Thresh** | A threshold displacement whereby if the spring stretches more than this amount, it resets in order to avoid errors introduced by sudden, large displacements such as those caused by teleporting Actors. |
| **No ZSpring** | If enabled, the displacement in the Z axis is ignored by the spring and is always correct. |

## Two Bone IK

The **Two Bone IK** control applies an Inverse Kinematic (IK) solver to a 3-joint chain, such as the limbs of a character.
