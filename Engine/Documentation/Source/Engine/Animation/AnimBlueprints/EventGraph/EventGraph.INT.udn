[EXCERPT:Intro]
Every Animation Blueprint has a single **EventGraph**, which is a standard [graph](Engine/Blueprints/Editor/UIComponents/GraphEditor) 
that uses a collection of special animation-related events to initiate sequences of nodes. The most common use of the EventGraph 
is to update values used by BlendSpaces and other blend nodes to drive animations within the AnimGraph.

For example, the EventGraph of an Animation Blueprint could use the velocity of the owning Pawn to determine direction and speed. These two values can then be used as inputs into a BlendSpace within the AnimGraph to blend between an idle animation and various directional movement animations. Similarly, the pitch and yaw of the owning Pawn can be used as inputs into another BlendSpace to blend between various aiming poses applied additively in order to cause the mesh to aim where it is looking while still maintaining the previously mentioned movement animations.

## Working with the EventGraph

For general information on working with node graphs, see the [Working with Nodes](Engine/Blueprints/Editor/UIComponents/GraphEditor) documentation.

## Animation Events

Various events are called by the animation system to initialize and update the Animation Blueprint. These can be placed in the Event Graph to implement or override functionality.
