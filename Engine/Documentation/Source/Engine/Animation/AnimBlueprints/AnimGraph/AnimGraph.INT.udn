[EXCERPT:Intro]
The **AnimGraph** is used to evaluate a final pose for the SkeletalMesh for the current frame. By default, 
each Animation Blueprint has an AnimGraph which can have [animation nodes](Engine/Animation/AnimBlueprints/AnimGraph#AnimationNodes) placed within it 
to sample AnimationSequences, perform animation blends, or control bone transforms using SkeletalControls. 
The resulting pose is then applied to the SkeletalMesh each frame.

Inside the AnimGraph you can use values calculated in the **EventGraph** or elsewhere, likely in code, 
and use those as inputs for BlendSpaces or other blend nodes. Of course, you can also just sample 
AnimationSequences directly without any special blending. The AnimGraph also allows for the use of 
SkeletalControls to modify bone positions, rotations, and scales directly.

## Execution Flow

All graphs have a flow of execution shown as pulsing links between exec pins on the graph's nodes. For 
regular graphs, such as the **EventGraph** of a Blueprint, this flow is visualized during play as it is 
dependent on the firing of events. The **AnimGraph** is different in that it displays the flow of execution 
at all times since it is not event-based and is being evaluated each frame.

In the **AnimGraph**, the flow of execution represents poses being passed from one node to another. Some 
nodes, such as [blends](Engine/Animation/NodeReference/Blend), have multiple inputs and make a 
decision internally on which input is currently part of the flow of execution. This determination is usually 
dependent on some external input, like the value passed to a data pin.

In the example below, the same blend node from above switched the execution flow between its inputs based on 
the value of its Alpha pin (the value is being manually set for simplicity):

## Working with the AnimGraph

The **AnimGraph** works by evaluating a graph of nodes. Some of these nodes perform some specific operation 
on one or more input poses, while others are used to access or sample other types of assets, such as AnimationSequences, 
BlendSpaces, or AnimMontages. These assets and nodes, as well as how they fit into the **AnimGraph**, are described below.
