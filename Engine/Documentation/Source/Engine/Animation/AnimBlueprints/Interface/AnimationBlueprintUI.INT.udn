## Menu Bar

The **Menu Bar** gives you access to common editor actions such as saving, undoing and redoing, as well as several Persona-specific menus. For instance, the **Asset Browser** tab allows
you to change the default preview mesh, remove unused bones from the skeleton, and record animations. 


## Toolbar

The Animation Blueprint **Toolbar** contains many of the same options as other Blueprint Toolbars.

## Viewport
The **Viewport** displays the Skeletal Mesh with any animations activated by current variable values.

## Graph

The tabbed **Graph** panel displays whichever graph is currently selected.


### EventGraph Tab

The **EventGraph** tab contains any animation event nodes that trigger the updates of the Skeletal Mesh poses.  It can also contain animation nodes that set variable values that determine which animation asset is played when.

### AnimGraph Tab

The **AnimGraph** tab contains the State Machine that hooks up all the actual animations and States, along with any other animation nodes you want.

![](AnimGraphUI_AnimGraph.png)

For more information about State Machines, see **[](Engine/Animation/StateMachines)**.

[REGION:note]
Although you could put all your animation nodes directly into the AnimGraph tab, it is more efficient to organize them into a State Machine, States, and Transitions (Rules), for ease of upkeep and simplicity.

## Anim Preview Editor

The **Anim Preview Editor** panel displays all of your Animation Blueprint's variables, in their assigned categories. You can manually modify the variable values here to preview and test different animations in the viewport.

For more information, see **[](Engine/Animation/Persona\BlueprintDefaults)**.


## Asset Override Editor

The **Asset Override Editor** panel displays all of your animation assets that are referenced by the parent animation graph. If there are no nodes referencing assets in the parent class or this is not a derived blueprint there will be nothing displayed in this panel.

## Asset Browser Tab

The Asset Browser tab contains a list of all the animation assets in your Animation Blueprint.

![](AnimGraphUI_AssetBrowser.png)

By default, you can find the Asset Browser tab next to the **My Blueprint** tab, underneath the Graph.


## My Blueprint Tab

The My Blueprint tab contains a list of all the graphs and variables in your Animation Blueprint.

![](AnimGraphUI_MyBP.png)

By default, you can find the **My Blueprint** tab next to the **Asset Browser** tab, underneath the Graph.


## Details Panel

The **Details** panel displays the properties of selected elements.

![](AnimGraphUI_Details.png)

## Palette

The **Palette** panel contains all the nodes available for use in the Animation Blueprint's various graphs. In the top panel any nodes marked as a "favorite" will be displayed here.

[REGION:note]
The Palette may not be visible by default.  If it is not, you can open it by clicking **Palette** on the **Window** menu.
