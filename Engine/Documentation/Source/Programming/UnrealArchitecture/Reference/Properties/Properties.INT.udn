Description:Reference for creating and implementing properties for gameplay classes.
Version: 4.9

## Property Declaration

Properties are declared using standard C++ variable syntax, preceeded by the UPROPERTY macro which defines property metadata and variable specifiers.

	UPROPERTY([specifier, specifier, ...], [meta(key=value, key=value, ...)])
	Type VariableName;

## Core Data Types

### Integers
The convention for integral data types is "int" or "uint" followed by the size in bits.

|Variable Type | Description |
| ------------| -------------|
| **uint8**	 | 8-bit  unsigned|
| **uint16**	| 16-bit unsigned|
| **uint32**	| 32-bit unsigned|
| **uint64**	| 64-bit unsigned|
| **int8**	| 8-bit  signed|
| **int16**	| 16-bit signed|
| **int32**	| 32-bit signed|
| **int64** | 64-bit signed|

### Floating Point Types
Unreal uses the standard C++ floating point types, float and double.

### Boolean Types
Boolean types can be represented either with the C++ bool keyword or as a bitfield.

	uint32 bIsHungry : 1;
    bool bIsThirsty;

### Strings
Unreal supports 3 core types of strings.
* FString is a classic "dynamic array of chars" string type.
* FName is a reference to an immutable case-insensitive string in a global string table.  It is smaller and more efficient to pass around than a FString, but more difficult to manipulate.
* FText is a more robust string representation designed to handle localization.

For most uses, Unreal relies on the TCHAR type for characters.  The TEXT() macro is available to denote TCHAR literals.

	MyDogPtr->DogName = FName(TEXT("Samson Aloysius"));

For more on the three string types, when to use each one, and how to work with them, see the [String Handling documentation](Programming/UnrealArchitecture/StringHandling).
