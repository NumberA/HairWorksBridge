<!-- An Actor is the base type of Object that can be placed or [spawned](Programming\UnrealArchitecture\Actors\Spawning) into the world. A good short description of Actor would be "a collection of Components that tick". In reality, Actors can do 
many things; check out `Actor.h` for all the included variables and functions.

[INCLUDE:Shared/Glossary/A#glossary_actor] Further, they do not store Transform (Location, Rotation, and Scale) data; that is stored in the Root Component.

Actors are not generally garbage collected, as the World Object holds a list of Actor references. Actors can be explicitly destroyed by calling `Destroy()`. This removes them from the level and marks them 
as "pending kill", which means they will hang around until they are cleaned up on the next garbage collection.

## Actor Creation

Creating new instances of `AActor` classes is called **spawning**. This can be done using the generic `SpawnActor()` function or one of its specialized templated versions.

See [](Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Actors/Spawning) for detailed info on the various methods of creating instances of `AActor` classes for gameplay.


## Components

**Actors** can be thought of, in one sense, as containers that hold special types of **Objects** called [Components](Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Actors/Components). Different types of Components 
can be used to control how Actors move, how they are rendered, etc. The other main function of Actors is the [replication](#Replication) of properties and function calls across the network 
during play.

Components are associated with their containing Actor when they are created.

A few of the key types of Components are:

$ UActorComponent : This is the base Component. It can be included as part of an Actor. It can Tick if you want it to.

$ USceneComponent : This is a Component that is a "physical" thing, in that it can exist in the world. SceneComponents have transforms, which means they can move around and interact with other things 
in the world. They can also join together in an attachment hierarchy.

$ UPrimitiveComponent : This is a Component that can not only exist in the world, but has a representation of some kind (e.g. a mesh or a particle system). Many of the interesting physics and collision 
settings are here.

Actors support having a hierarchy of SceneComponents. Each Actor also has a `RootComponent` property that designates which Component acts as the root for the Actor. Actors themselves do not have transforms, and thus do not have locations, 
rotations, or scales. Instead, they rely on the transforms of their Components; more specifically, their root Component. If this Component is a **SceneComponent**, it provides the transformation 
information for the Actor. Otherwise, the Actor will have no transform. Other attached Components have a transform relative to the Component they are attached to. 

An example Actor and hierarchy might look something like this:

| GoldPickup Actor | Hierarchy | 
| ------------------| -----------|
| ![](GoldPickupExampleActor.png)(w:400) | [INCLUDE:#goldhierarchy] | 

<!--
[EXCERPT:GoldHierarchy]
* **Root - SceneComponent**: Basic scene Component to set the Actor's base location in the world.
	* **StaticMeshComponent**: Mesh representing gold ore. 
		* **ParticleSystemComponent**: Sparkling particle emitter attached to the gold ore.
		* **AudioComponent**: Looping metallic chiming audio emitter attached to the gold ore.
		* **BoxComponent**: Collision box to use as trigger for overlap event for picking up the gold.

## Ticking

Ticking refers to how Objects are updated in Unreal Engine. All Objects have the ability to be ticked each frame, allowing you to perform any update calculations or actions that are necessary.

Actors all have the ability to be ticked by default via the `TickActor()` function. This function is executed every frame by the engine.

**ActorComponents** also have the ability to be updated by default. See the [Updating section](Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Actors/Components#Updating) of the Components page for more information.


## Lifecycle

See the [Actor Lifecycle](Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Actors/ActorLifecycle) documentation for more information on how an Actor is created and removed from the game.


## Replication

**Replication** is used to keep the Actors within the world in sync when dealing with networked multiplayer games. Property values and function calls can both be replicated, allowing for complete 
control over the state of the game on all clients.
