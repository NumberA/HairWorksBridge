%Steps%

Currently, your projectiles:

*	Live forever (evidenced by the fact that they never disappear in the Scene Outliner)
*	Don't collide with other objects in the world

During this step, we're going to set-up projectile collision and lifetime.

## Limiting the Projectile's Life Span

1.	Locate the `FPSProjectile` class implementation file in the **Solution Explorer** and open `FPSProjectile.cpp`.

1.	Add the following code to the `FPSProjectile` constructor to set the projectile's lifespan:

		// Die after 3 seconds (by default)
		InitialLifeSpan = 3.f;

## Editing the Projectile's Collision Settings

UE4 comes with several useful collision chanels; however, the engine also provides several customizable channels that game projects can use.

1. Open **Project Settings** and select **Collision** to customize a collision channel.

1.	Select **New Object Channel...** to create a new collision channel. Name your new collision channel "Projectile" and make sure that the **Default Response** is set to **Block** before clicking **Accept**.

1.	Select **New...** under **Preset** and name your new profile "Projectile" as well. Refer to the following image to set your collision presets.

	[REGION:note]
	The profile shown above specifies that the projectile will be blocked by `Static Actors`, `Pawns`, `Dynamic Actors`, `Actors` simulating `Physics`, `Vehicles`, and `Destructible Actors`.

## Using the New Collision Channel's Settings

1.	Locate the `FPSProjectile` class implementation file in the **Solution Explorer** and open `FPSProjectile.cpp`.

1.	In the `FPSProjectile` constructor, add the following line after the creation of `CollisionComp`:

		CollisionComp->BodyInstance.SetCollisionProfileName("Projectile");

1.	`FPSProjectile.cpp` should now look like the following:

		// Fill out your copyright notice in the Description page of Project Settings.
		
		#include "FPSProject.h"
		#include "FPSProjectile.h"
		
		// Sets default values
		AFPSProjectile::AFPSProjectile()
		{
		 	// Set this actor to call Tick() every frame.  You can turn this off to improve performance if you don't need it.
			PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = true;
			
			// Die after 3 seconds (by default)
			InitialLifeSpan = 3.f;
		}
		
		// Constructor
		AFPSProjectile::AFPSProjectile(const FObjectInitializer& ObjectInitializer) : Super(ObjectInitializer)
		{
			// Use a sphere as a simple collision representation
			CollisionComp = ObjectInitializer.CreateDefaultSubobject<USphereComponent>(this, TEXT("SphereComp"));
		
			if (CollisionComp != NULL)
			{
				CollisionComp->BodyInstance.SetCollisionProfileName("Projectile");
				CollisionComp->InitSphereRadius(15.f);
				RootComponent = CollisionComp;
		
				// Use a ProjectileMovementComponent to govern this projectile's movement
				ProjectileMovement = ObjectInitializer.CreateDefaultSubobject<UProjectileMovementComponent>(this, TEXT("ProjectileComp"));
		
				if (ProjectileMovement != NULL)
				{
					ProjectileMovement->UpdatedComponent = CollisionComp;
					ProjectileMovement->InitialSpeed = 3000.f;
					ProjectileMovement->MaxSpeed = 3000.f;
					ProjectileMovement->bRotationFollowsVelocity = true;
					ProjectileMovement->bShouldBounce = true;
					ProjectileMovement->Bounciness = 0.3f;
				}
			}
		}
		
		// Called when the game starts or when spawned
		void AFPSProjectile::BeginPlay()
		{
			Super::BeginPlay();
			
		}
		
		// Called every frame
		void AFPSProjectile::Tick( float DeltaTime )
		{
			Super::Tick( DeltaTime );
		
		}
		
		// Initiallizes velocity of the projectile in the shoot direction
		void AFPSProjectile::InitVelocity(const FVector& ShootDirection)
		{
			if (ProjectileMovement != NULL)
			{
				// set the projectile's velocity to the desired direction
				ProjectileMovement->Velocity = ShootDirection * ProjectileMovement->InitialSpeed;
			}
		}

1.	Save `FPSProjectile.cpp` in Visual Studio.

1.	Locate **FPSProject** in the **Solution Explorer**.

1.	**Right-click** on **FPSProject** and select **Build** to compile your project.
