Making sure that the SteamVR hardware is properly setup and that the correct software is installed on your development PC is of vital importance to ensuring that the SteamVR hardware will work correctly with Unreal Engine 4.

1. Make sure to clear a 12 x 9ft / 4 x 3M area of all objects that you could trip over or hit while you are using SteamVR.

1. Ensure that the Vive Head Mounted Display (HMD), Steam Controllers, Breakout box, and Lighthouse Base stations are all unpacked, powered on, connected and setup according the the [instruction](http://media.steampowered.com/apps/steamvr/vr_setup.pdf) provide by Valve.

1. Once everything is connected and turned on, pick up the Vive HMD so that the lenses are facing you.
On the **Left Hand Side** of the Vive HMD there is a small **Black Button** with a small light above it. 
Currently the light should be **red** meaning that the Vive HMD is in standby mode. 
Press and hold the **Black Button** in for **5 Seconds** and the red light should change to **green**, meaning the Vive HMD is now ready to be used.

	Keep in mind that in order for the Vive HMD to work correctly you will need to have a **[USB 3.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_3.0)** port available to use on your development PC.
