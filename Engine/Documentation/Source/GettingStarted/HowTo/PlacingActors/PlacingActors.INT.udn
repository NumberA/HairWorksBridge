At the most fundamental level, an **Actor** is any Object that you can place in a level and this page will show you the various methods in which you can place those Actors inside your levels.

[REGION:note]
For this How To guide, we have created a new project using the **Blueprint Third Person** template with **Starter Content** enabled. If you have not created a project based off a template before or are not sure how to enable Starter Content, refer to the [](Engine/Basics/Projects/Browser) page for information on creating/opening projects, templates, and project settings.

## Place Mode

This section will show you how to place Actors from the **Modes** menu while in [Place Mode](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Modes/PlaceMode). 

1.  With your project open, in the upper left corner of the screen you will see the **Modes** window.

	Each Actor displayed on each tab under Place Mode can be dragged-and-dropped into a level. 

## Context Menu

This section will demonstrate how to place Actors from the [Content Browser](Engine/Content/Browser) in your level through a **Context Menu**. 

1.  Inside your project, in the lower left corner of the screen you will see the **Content Browser**.

## Drag-and-Drop

## Class Viewer

A more advanced method of placing Actors is performed by using the [](Engine/UI/ClassViewer), which is a hierarchical list of classes used by the Editor.

1.  To open the **Class Viewer**, click **Window** then **Developer Tools** and under **Miscellaneous**, select **Class Viewer**.
