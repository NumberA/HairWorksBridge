/**
 * Interface for media streams.
 *
 * A media stream is a sequence of data of a uniform media type, such as audio or video.
 * Media file containers may consist of a single stream or they may contain multiple
 * streams of different types, for example video streams with different encodings or
 * multiple audio and caption text streams for different languages.
 *
 * Track processing can be enabled and disabled while media playback is in progress.
 * Use the Enable() and Disable() methods respectively. Whether a stream is enabled by
 * default is determined by the media file. For video files the video stream as well
 * as the audio stream for the default language are usually enabled by default.
 *
 * Some stream types may be mutually exclusive, which means that the media player can
 * play only one stream of a certain type at a time. For example, if a video contains
 * multiple audio streams, only one of them may be enabled. Use the IsMutuallyExclusive
 * method to determine whether two streams are mutually exclusive.
